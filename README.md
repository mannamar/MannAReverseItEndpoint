# MannAReverseItEndpoint

Project Description:
A ReverseIt application that will take in a string as user input and output its reverse

Instructions:
1. Download the files and put them in their own folder, open the folder in VS Code, and start debugging (F5)
2. Navigate to "http://localhost:5185/ReverseIt" for the default output (you may need to change the port if it's different on your system > see debug console)
3. Append URL with any string of your choosing such as "http://localhost:5185/ReverseIt/ABCDEFG" for a customized output
4. Enjoy!

Peer reviewed by Jovann Contreras: The program runs with no errors, code is understandable and clean, I really like how Amar found a way to input something without having to call the route I thought it was really cool. Another thing I liked was how he go the original word to display and also displayed the reversed word.
