# MannAReverseItEndpoint

Peer reviewed by Jovann Contreras: The program runs with no errors, code is understandable and clean, I really like how Amar found a way to input something without having to call the route I thought it was really cool. Another thing I liked was how he go the original word to display and also displayed the reversed word.
